          Thanks to support from Google and The Font Bureau, Bungee is released under the SIL Open Font License, meaning
          that it is completely free and open-source.

          Making Bungee has been a great way for me to play with emerging font technologies. I sell most of my fonts
          commercially, but I belive Bungee is well-suited to a libre license because of its focus on emerging features
          like chromatic layers and vertical writing. Bungee was part of Microsoft’s early experiments with color fonts,
          and I hope that as a libre font, it will continue to encourage experimentation and development in this area.
          More widespread use of color fonts and vertical text will lead to better support, and I want Bungee to be a
          resource for designers and developers, professional and amateur alike. (If you wish to support my work,
          consider purchasing one of my retail typefaces!)

          This responsive webpage was created by Nick Sherman, Chris Lewis, and me. Like Bungee itself, its layout can
          switch from vertical to horizontal (depending on the dimensions of your screen).
