          than the proportions of any individual letter. I drew Bungee’s round and diagonal characters with straight
          sides (see O and A), which reinforces their verticality and creates words with well-defined left and right
          edges. Letters that are unusually wide, narrow, or asymmetrical (such as I, L, M, and W) can be especially
          tricky. You can <a class="underline decoration-solid text-yellow-200 hover:text-yellow-300"

            these letters</a> or play with Bungee’s alternates to get the best results for your
          design.
