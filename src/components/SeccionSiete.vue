          I began by drawing each of Bungee’s letterforms on its side, rotated 90° counter-clockwise. This allowed me to
          use horizontal tools to make a vertical design, but also presented me with some unusual design challenges. You
          can use this rotated version of Bungee in applications that cannot take advantage of Bungee’s OpenType
          vertical capabilities. <a class="underline decoration-solid text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700"

            rotating the text box</a> 90° clockwise, you can simulate vertical text in almost any
          environment.
